# Chicken Tinder 

## Statement of Intent

Help users find a place to eat for dinner. They will be able to form groups of people to eat with (2-10) and all members can thumbs up or down restaurant suggestions until they get a match. Users can also toggle to recipe mode, which would be my previously-built Flavor Forecast app.
